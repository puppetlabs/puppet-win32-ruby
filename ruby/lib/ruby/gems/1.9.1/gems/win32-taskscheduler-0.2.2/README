  gem install win32-taskscheduler

= Documentation
  If you installed this library as a gem then the documentation was built for
  you and can be viewed if your gem server is running. There is also some
  documentation on the github wiki page.

  Otherwise, you can look at the doc/taskscheduler.txt file which should have
  everything you need.

= Acknowledgements
  This library was modeled to some degree on the Win32::TaskScheduler Perl
  module by Umberto Nicoletti. However, there are some differences. Please see
  the documentation for details.
