== 0.3.6 - 6-Feb-2010
* Bug fixes for Ruby 1.9.x. Thanks go to Kendall Gifford for the spot and
  the patch.

  are now set to their display name.
* Fixed a bug in the create_junction method.
* Added an 'example' rake task to run the example code.
* Renamed the example program from dir_test.rb to dir_example.rb to prevent
  any potential confusion that it's a genuine test file.
