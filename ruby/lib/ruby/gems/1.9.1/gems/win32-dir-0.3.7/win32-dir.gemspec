    The win32-dir library provides extra methods and constants for the
    builtin Dir class. The constants provide a convenient way to identify
    certain directories across all versions of Windows. Some methods have
    been added, such as the ability to create junctions. Others have been
    modified to provide a more consistent result for MS Windows.
