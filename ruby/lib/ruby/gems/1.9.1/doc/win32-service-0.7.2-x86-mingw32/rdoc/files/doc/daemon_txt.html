      <h1>Description</h1>
<pre>
  The Daemon class is a wrapper class that allows you to run your code as a
  Windows service.
</pre>
<h1>Synopsis</h1>
<pre>
  class Daemon
    def service_main
      while running?
        sleep 3
        File.open(&quot;c:\\test.log&quot;, &quot;a&quot;){ |f| f.puts &quot;service is running&quot; }
      end
    end
  end

  Daemon.mainloop
</pre>
<h1>Singleton Methods</h1>
<p>
Daemon.mainloop
</p>
<pre>
  This is the method that actually puts your code into a loop and allows it
  to run as a service. The code that is actually run while in the mainloop
  is what you defined in the Daemon#service_main method.
</pre>
<h1>Instance Methods</h1>
<p>
Daemon#running?
</p>
<pre>
  Returns whether or not the daemon is running. This is just a shortcut
  for checking if the state is RUNNING, PAUSED or IDLE.

  This is typically used within your service_main method. See the
  demo_daemon.rb file in the 'examples' directory for an example of how it's
  used in practice.
</pre>
<p>
Daemon#service_init
</p>
<pre>
  Any code defined defined within this method occurs before service_main is
  reached. Any initialization code that takes more than two seconds to
  execute should be placed here. Otherwise, your service may timeout when
  you try to start it.
</pre>
<p>
Daemon#service_main(*args)
</p>
<pre>
  You are expected to define your own service_main() method. The code
  defined in this method is the code that will run while running as a
  service.

  Any +args+ passed to Service.start are passed to this method.
</pre>
<p>
Daemon#state
</p>
<pre>
  Returns the current state of the Daemon. For a list of valid states, see
  the Constants section below.
</pre>
<h1>Signal Event Hooks</h1>
<pre>
  These methods are called if defined within your Daemon class, and the
  appropriate signal is received by your service.
</pre>
<p>
Daemon#service_stop
</p>
<pre>
  Called if the service receives a SERVICE_CONTROL_STOP signal. This is
  what the Service.stop() method sends.
</pre>
<p>
Daemon#service_pause
</p>
<pre>
  Called if the service receives a SERVICE_CONTROL_PAUSE signal. This is
  what the Service.pause() method sends.
</pre>
<p>
Daemon#service_resume
</p>
<pre>
  Called if the service receives a SERVICE_CONTROL_CONTINUE signal. This
  is what the Service.resume() method sends.
</pre>
<p>
Daemon#service_interrogate
</p>
<pre>
  Called if the service receives a SERVICE_CONTROL_INTERROGATE signal. This
  notifies a service that it should report its current status information to
  the service control manager.
</pre>
<p>
Daemon#service_shutdown
</p>
<pre>
  Called if the service receives a SERVICE_CONTROL_SHUTDOWN signal.
</pre>
<p>
Daemon#service_netbindadd
</p>
<pre>
  Called if the service receives a SERVICE_CONTROL_NETBINDADD signal. This
  notifies a network service that there is a new component for binding.
</pre>
<p>
Daemon#service_netbinddisable
</p>
<pre>
  Called if the service receives a SERVICE_CONTROL_NETBINDDISABLE signal.
  This notifies a network service that one of its bindings has been
  disabled.
</pre>
<p>
Daemon#service_netbindenable
</p>
<pre>
  Called if the service receives a SERVICE_CONTROL_NETBINDENABLE signal.
  This  Notifies a network service that a disabled binding has been enabled.
</pre>
<p>
Daemon#service_netbindremove
</p>
<pre>
  Called if the service receives a SERVICE_CONTROL_NETBINDREMOVE signal.
  This notifies a network service that that a component for binding has
  been removed.
</pre>
<p>
Daemon#service_paramchange
</p>
<pre>
  Called if the service receives a SERVICE_CONTROL_PARAMCHANGE signal.
  This notifies a service that its startup parameters have changed.
</pre>
<h1>Constants</h1>
<h3>Service state constants</h3>
<p>
Daemon::CONTINUE_PENDING
</p>
<pre>
  The service continue is pending.
</pre>
<p>
Daemon::PAUSE_PENDING
</p>
<pre>
  The service pause is pending.
</pre>
<p>
Daemon::PAUSED
</p>
<pre>
  The service is paused (but not STOPPED).
</pre>
<p>
Daemon::RUNNING
</p>
<pre>
  The service is running.
</pre>
<p>
Daemon::START_PENDING
</p>
<pre>
  The service is starting (but is not yet in a RUNNING state).
</pre>
<p>
Daemon::STOP_PENDING
</p>
<pre>
  The service is stopping (but is not yet in a STOPPED state).
</pre>
<p>
Daemon::STOPPED
</p>
<pre>
  The service is not running.
</pre>
<p>
Daemon::IDLE
</p>
<pre>
  The service is running, in an idle state. This is a custom state that
  we added that gets around a thread blocking issue.
</pre>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<pre>
  You must create a service before you can actually run it. Look in the
  examples directory for the files 'demo_daemon.rb' and 'demodaemon_ctl.rb'.
  They're small and straightforward examples of how to control, install and
  setup your own Daemon.
</pre>
<h1>Known Bugs</h1>
<pre>
  None known.  Please report any bugs you find on the Bug tracker at
  http://rubyforge.org/projects/win32utils.
</pre>
<h1>Future Plans</h1>
<pre>
  Rewrite the Daemon class in pure Ruby.

  Suggestions welcome. Please log them on the Feature Request tracker at
  http://rubyforge.org/projects/win32utils
</pre>
<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
<pre>
  Many thanks go to Patrick Hurley for providing the fix for the thread
  blocking issue. Thanks also go to Kevin Burge for his patch that solved
  service responsiveness issues.
