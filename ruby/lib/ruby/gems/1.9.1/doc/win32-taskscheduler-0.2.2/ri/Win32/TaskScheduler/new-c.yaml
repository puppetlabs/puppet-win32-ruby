- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Returns a new TaskScheduler object. If a work_item (and possibly the the trigger) are passed as arguments then a new work item is created and associated with that trigger, although you can still activate other tasks with the same handle.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This is really just a bit of convenience. Passing arguments to the constructor is the same as calling TaskScheduler.new plus TaskScheduler#new_work_item.
