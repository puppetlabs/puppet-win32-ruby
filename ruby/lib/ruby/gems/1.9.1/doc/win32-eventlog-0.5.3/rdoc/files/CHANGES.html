      <h2>0.5.3 - 26-Oct-2011</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the <a href="../classes/String.html#M000001">String#nstrip</a> method
for Ruby 1.9.x. Thanks go to Jason Bourne for the spot and Ben Jansen for
the patch.

</li>
<li>Refactored the Rakefile and tests.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.5.2 - 21-Aug-2009</h2>
<ul>
<li>EventLogStruct&#8216;s are now frozen on read operations. This is read-only
data.

</li>
<li>Added a test to validate that structs are frozen.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.5.1 - 8-Aug-2009</h2>
<ul>
<li>License changed to Artistic 2.0.

</li>
<li>Some gemspec updates; test-unit and ptools are now development dependencies
instead of runtime dependencies and the description has been updated.

</li>
<li>Some RDoc updates, including documentation of the event type constants.

</li>
<li>Several RDoc updates for the <a
href="../classes/Win32/MC.html">Win32::MC</a> class.

</li>
<li>Minor refactoring of the test suite.

</li>
<li>Added rake tasks for running the mc or eventlog libraries separately, as
well as tasks for running the examples.

</li>
<li>Example programs renamed to avoid any confusion with actual test files.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.5.0 - 12-Sep-2008</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue for Windows Vista and later where some event descriptions
were missing. This fix requires windows-pr 0.9.3 or later.

</li>
<li>The EventLog#full? method now raises an EventLog::Error if it should fail
instead of a StandardError.

</li>
<li>Minor tweak to mc.rb - chomp the input file name if run as a program.

</li>
<li>Added test-unit 2.0.0 or later as a dependency.

</li>
<li>Added ptools as a dependency for the sake of the test suite.

</li>
<li>Renamed the test files to start with &#8216;test_&#8217;.

</li>
<li>Removed the ts_all.rb file.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.4.9 - 7-Sep-2008</h2>
<ul>
<li>The private get_description method, which is used internally to read the
event log, has been updated to work with 64 bit Windows. The changes needed
for this require a more recent windows-pr library, i.e. 0.9.2 or later.

</li>
<li>Now properly separates the string inserts and description in the private
method get_last_event. This fixes the description and string_insert
properties for both the EventLog#tail and EventLog#notify_change methods.

</li>
<li>Some internal refactoring to use begin/ensure where appropriate.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.4.8 - 17-May-2008</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed in a bug in the EventLog#read method where a log entry requiring over
64k would fail and spiral into an infinite loop. Thanks go to Stuart Clarke
for the spot.

</li>
<li>Improved handling of failed log reading in the read_last_event private
method.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.4.7 - 8-Dec-2007</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where you couldn&#8216;t write to custom (parent) event
sources. Thanks go to Tim Uckun for the spot.

</li>
<li>Now handles ParameterMessageFiles, both in the EventLog.add_event_source
method and in terms of getting event descriptions properly. Thanks go to
botp for spotting the description problem.

</li>
<li>The EventLog.open_backup method handles a block the same way that the
EventLog.open method does.

</li>
<li>The EventLog.add_event_source now returns the creation disposition instead
of self.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.4.6 - 27-Aug-2007</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reading event logs is now approximately 5-7 times faster!

</li>
<li>Fixed a potential bug where, in rare cases, event descriptions could be
overwritten by other event descriptions.

</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where, in unusual cases, there was leading garbage in the event
descriptions.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.4.5 - 25-Aug-2007</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed two potential issues where reading from remote event log sources
could fail either due to permissions (reading DLL&#8216;s) or because local
registry entries didn&#8216;t necessarily match the remote registry
entries. Thanks go to Andrew Garberoglio and Ivan Shiel for the spot.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.4.4 - 31-Jul-2007</h2>
<ul>
<li>The EventLogError class is now EventLog::Error.

</li>
<li>The MCError class is now MC::Error.

</li>
<li>Added a Rakefile with tasks for installation and testing.

</li>
<li>Removed the install.rb file. Installation is now handled by the Rakefile.

</li>
<li>Fixed some bad test cases in tc_eventlog.rb.

</li>
<li>Added some more source comments.

</li>
<li>Updates to the README and MANIFEST file.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.4.3 - 18-Dec-2006</h2>
<ul>
<li>Removed the FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_SYSTEM flag to the FormatMessage function
in the get_description private method because it could sometimes return
bogus information. Thanks go to Greg Holmes for the spot.

</li>
<li>Added the string_inserts member to the EventLogStruct. This contains an
array of only the raw string inserts, rather than the entire text message.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.4.2 - 6-Aug-2006</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in the EventLog.read method related to the
EVENTLOG_BACKWARDS_READ flag.

</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the EventLog.read method where the event_type was not being
set properly. Thanks go to &quot;TheR&quot; for the spot and the fix.

</li>
<li>Fixed bugs in the EventLog#tail method where it would fail if the log was
full and dups would appear.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.4.1 - 28-May-2006</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in the EventLog#notify_change method where the handle would die
after five or six reads. Thanks go to botp for the spot.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.4.0 - 24-May-2006</h2>
<ul>
<li>Now pure Ruby.

</li>
<li>Now includes a gemspec.

</li>
<li>Fixed a major bug the EventLog#tail method where it was reading the log in
the wrong order (!!!).

</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the EventLog#report_event with regards to long
category_id&#8216;s. Actually, this wasn&#8216;t so much &quot;fixed&quot;
as &quot;avoided&quot; by virtue of using a pure Ruby solution.

</li>
<li>Added the EventLog#full? method.

</li>
<li>Documentation updates and corrections, including the tutorial on creating
and writing to your own event source.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.3.3 - 2-Jan-2006</h2>
<ul>
<li>If EventLog.new fails, it now raises EventLogError instead of
StandardError.

</li>
<li>Added documentation to the eventlog.txt file for EventLog#notify_change.

</li>
<li>Added inline rdoc to the C source code.

</li>
<li>Code cleanup.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.3.2 - 26-May-2005</h2>
<ul>
<li>Code now more Unicode friendly, and other cleanup.

</li>
<li>Made the .txt files rdoc friendly, and removed the .rd files.

</li>
<li>Minor adjustments to the test suite.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>0.3.1 - 16-Feb-2005</h3>
<ul>
<li>Minor modifications to the source to eliminate some warnings that appeared
in Ruby 1.8.2 or later, plus other minor tweaks.

</li>
<li>Renamed the sample programs and moved the &#8216;examples&#8217; directory
to the toplevel directory.

</li>
<li>Made this document rdoc friendly.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.3.0 - 30-Oct-2004</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added the notify_change() and tail() methods.

</li>
<li>Added the write() alias for report_event().

</li>
<li>The read() class and instance methods now return an array of structs if no
block is given.

</li>
<li>Added the &#8216;rubymsg.mc&#8217; message category file. If installed,
this will create a &#8216;RubyMsg&#8217; event source for use with
win32-service, though you may use it for whatever you wish. See the README
for more details.

</li>
<li>Renamed struct back to EventLogStruct - sorry, sorry - I promise I
won&#8216;t change this again.

</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where using EventLog::SEEK_READ did not work properly (thanks
Park).

</li>
<li>Added the notify.rb test script under doc/examples.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.2.5 - 28-Oct-2004</h2>
<ul>
<li>Modified the open() and read() class methods to default to
&quot;Application&quot; for the default Event source.

</li>
<li>Removed the .html files. You can generate these on your own with rd2.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.2.4 - 19-Oct-2004</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where a segfault would result if an Event Log entry were
somehow corrupted. Thanks go again to Joey Gibson for the spot.

</li>
<li>Very minor doc corrections in tutorial.txt and eventlog.txt

</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.2.3 - 14-Oct-2004</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where some Event Log descriptions were returning nil instead of
the actual description. Thanks go to Joey Gibson for the spot.

</li>
<li>Minor test suite and doc additions, including a &quot;future plan&quot;
that may be of interest.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.2.2 - 02-Jul-2004</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in the read() method where not all the records were being
returned.

</li>
<li>Fixed calls to rb_time_new() - second argument appears to be mandatory as
of 1.8.2.

</li>
<li>Renamed struct returned by read() to &quot;EventLog&quot;.

</li>
<li>Changed struct members &quot;id&quot; and &quot;type&quot; to
&quot;event_id&quot; and &quot;event_type&quot;, respectively. This was to
avoid any confusion with the builtin Ruby methods of the same name.

</li>
<li>Replaced STR2CSTR() with StringValuePtr(), as the former is deprecated.
This means that as of this version, Ruby 1.8.0 or later is required.

</li>
<li>Moved the sample programs to doc/examples.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.2.1 - 04-Mar-2004</h2>
<ul>
<li>The add_event_source() and report_event() methods now accept symbols as
well as do key validation.

</li>
<li>Moved the EventLogError class under the <a
href="../classes/Win32.html">Win32</a> module.

</li>
<li>Normalized the tc_eventlog.rb and tc_mc.rb scripts by making it easier to
run them standalone from another directory.

</li>
<li>Minor modification to the build process.

</li>
<li>Added a test_write.rb script for general futzing when it comes to creating
and writing events to the log.

</li>
<li>Doc updates, warranty information added.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.2.0 - 1-Feb-2004</h2>
<ul>
<li>Changed the Win32EventLogError class to just EventLogError. I felt the <a
href="../classes/Win32.html">Win32</a> was redundant given that the class
is already under the <a href="../classes/Win32.html">Win32</a> module.

</li>
<li>Fixed bug where bogus error messages were returned because I was calling
GetLastError() too late.

</li>
<li>Fixed bug where error messages were getting cut off and/or garbled due to
\r\n character. (Thanks Park Heesob).

</li>
<li>Added open_backup class method.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.1.4 - 16-Jan-2004</h2>
<ul>
<li>Slightly better handling of the EventLog#close method. Adopted from code
previously submitted by Park Heesob.

</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the (internal) GetUser() function that caused a segfault if
there were 250+ records. That function has been greatly simplified.

</li>
<li>Removed the rb_ensure() approach. What I thought was a memory leak was not,
in fact, a memory leak. Also, it was slowing down the method considerably.

</li>
<li>Minor test suite update.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.1.3 - 7-Jan-2004</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed memory leaks in read() method (Park Heesob).

</li>
<li>Added read() class method (Daniel Berger).

</li>
<li>Test suite and doc additions &amp; updates

</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.1.2 - 30-Nov-2003</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added the report_event method. You can now write to the event log.

</li>
<li>Added the add_event_source class method, allowing you to register a custom
event source.

</li>
<li>Added the win32-mc package to the distribution. This is a simple wrapper to
generate .dll files from .mc files.

</li>
<li>Added Event Type constants

</li>
<li>Test suite additions

</li>
<li>Documentation updates and additions, including a small tutorial.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.1.1 - 5-Nov-2003</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the free() call, and added implicit eventlog closing (when the
EventLog object is free&#8216;d).

</li>
<li>Simplified constants by removing &#8216;EVENTLOG_&#8217; portion of name.

</li>
<li>Cleanup in the GetDescription() method, which was causing segfaults in
conjunction with TestUnit.

</li>
<li>Minor doc updates and cleanup.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.1.0 - 14-Oct-2003</h2>
<ul>
<li>Initial release

</li>
