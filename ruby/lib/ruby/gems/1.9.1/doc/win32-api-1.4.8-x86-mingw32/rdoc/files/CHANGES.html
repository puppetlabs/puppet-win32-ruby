      <h2>1.4.8 - 16-Jan-2011</h2>
<ul>
<li>A binary for both 1.8.x and 1.9.x is now shipped as part of the binary
build. A stub file is used to dynamically require the correct binary based
on your current version of Ruby.

</li>
<li>Some updates to the Rakefile to help build multiple binaries.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.4.7 - 4-Dec-2010</h2>
<ul>
<li>An internal error formatting function now resorts to the default LANGID on
error 1815 (ERROR_RESOURCE_LANG_NOT_FOUND). Thanks go to Little Snake for
the spot.

</li>
<li>Added a default Rake task and refactored the clean task.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.4.6 - 9-Feb-2010</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a warning that showed up with MinGW/gcc caused by an unnecessary
pointer dereference.

</li>
<li>Some updates to the Rakefile and gemspec. Gem building is now handled via
Rake tasks.

</li>
<li>Minor updates to the test suite.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.4.5 - 24-Aug-2009</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reverted the change in 1.4.4. We need unsigned longs in a few cases.
Consequently, you should upgrade windows-pr to 1.0.8 or later because some
return values were set to -1 instead of 0xFFFFFFFF as they are now.

</li>
<li>Updated one test to validate return value from failed function.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.4.4 - 18-Aug-2009</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where functions that returned a long return type were unsigned
instead of signed.

</li>
<li>The Rakefile has been refactored somewhat, including the removal of FFI
related tasks. Those are now in a separate branch in the repository.

</li>
<li>The test-unit library is now a development dependency instead of a runtime
dependency.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.4.3 - 23-Jun-2009</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bug fix for mingw.

</li>
<li>License now set to Artistic 2.0.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.4.2 - 31-May-2009</h2>
<ul>
<li>Updated the internal StringError() function to better handle the
possibility of the English .mui file not being found. Thanks go to Michel
Demazure for the spot.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.4.1 - 29-May-2009</h2>
<ul>
<li>Callback handling improvements.

</li>
<li>Updated the gemspec description.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.4.0 - 19-Feb-2009</h2>
<ul>
<li>Now compatible with Ruby 1.9.x.

</li>
<li>In what will go down as, &quot;It seemed like a good idea at the
time&quot;, I have removed the feature where W (wide) character functions
were used first if your $KCODE environment variable was set to
&quot;UTF8&quot;. It caused too many headaches in practice, especially
amongst Rails users. You must now always explicitly specify &#8216;W&#8217;
in the constructor if that&#8216;s what you want.

</li>
<li>Fixed RF bug 23944 - bad error message for MSVCRT functions that failed to
load properly.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.3.0 - 1-Jan-2009</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed RubyForge bug 23395, which was caused by inadvertently modifying a
variable within a loop. This caused callbacks to fail in certain
situations.

</li>
<li>Added the <a
href="../classes/Win32/API/LoadLibraryError.html">Win32::API::LoadLibraryError</a>
and <a
href="../classes/Win32/API/PrototypeError.html">Win32::API::PrototypeError</a>
classes to provide more fine grained handling of possible error conditions
in the constructor. These are both subclasses of <a
href="../classes/Win32/API/Error.html">Win32::API::Error</a>.

</li>
<li>Removed the Win32::API::CallbackError class.

</li>
<li>Changed the upper limit on prototypes from 16 to 20. It turns out that
there are actually Windows functions with more than 16 prototypes.

</li>
<li>Refactored a high iteration test so that it counts as only one test instead
of 1000.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.2.2 - 27-Nov-2008</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed bug in the error message for illegal prototypes and illegal return
types where the character in question would come out as empty or garbage.

</li>
<li>Passing a bad return type to <a
href="../classes/Win32/API/Callback.html">Win32::API::Callback</a> now
raises an error.

</li>
<li>Updated the error message for illegal return types to say, &quot;Illegal
return type&quot; instead of &quot;Illegal prototype&quot; as it did
previously.

</li>
<li>The error message for a bad function name passed to Win32::API.new now
matches JRuby&#8216;s FFI error message.

</li>
<li>Improved the handling of msvcrt functions with regards to skipping
&#8216;A&#8217; and &#8216;W&#8217; checks. Previously it was checking
against the literal string &#8216;msvcrt&#8217;. Now it checks against any
string that starts with &#8216;msvcr&#8217;.

</li>
<li>Added test-unit 2.x as a prerequisite.

</li>
<li>Added tests for the Win32::API::Callback#address method.

</li>
<li>Added tests to all <a href="../classes/Win32/API.html">Win32::API</a>
classes that explicitly check error messages.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.2.1 - 14-Nov-2008</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed and updated callback handling.

</li>
<li>Fixed wide string return handling for pointers and strings.

</li>
<li>Added the Win32::API::Callback#address instance method.

</li>
<li>All errors are now in English instead of your native language, because
that&#8216;s what Ruby itself does.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.2.0 - 22-Jul-2008</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added support for the &#8216;S&#8217; (string) prototype and return type.
It can be used instead of &#8216;P&#8217; (pointer) for const char*.

</li>
<li>Some internal refactoring. The attempts to load ANSI and/or Wide character
versions of functions are skipped for MSVCRT functions, since they do not
exist. This eliminates some unnecessary LoadLibrary() calls.

</li>
<li>Added a couple of gem building Rake tasks.

</li>
<li>Added a few more tests.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.1.0 - 12-Jun-2008</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added the Windows::API::Function class. This is a subclass of <a
href="../classes/Win32/API.html">Win32::API</a> meant only for use with raw
function pointers.

</li>
<li>Some documentation updates in the source and README files.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.0.6 - 18-Apr-2008</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added the effective_function_name method. This allows you to see what the
actual function name is that was defined, e.g. GetUserNameA vs
GetUserNameW.

</li>
<li>Replaced an instance of _tcscmp with strcmp. The case in question was
always going to be ASCII.

</li>
<li>Cleaned up some -W3 warnings.

</li>
<li>Added the build_manifest task to the Rakefile, which is automatically run
if you&#8216;re using a version of Ruby built with VC++ 8 or later. This
builds a ruby.exe.manifest file (if it doesn&#8216;t already exist).

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.0.5 - 20-Nov-2007</h2>
<ul>
<li>The API.new method now defaults to &quot;W&quot; (wide character functions)
before &quot;A&quot; (ANSI functions) if the $KCODE global variable is set
to &#8216;u&#8217; (UTF8).

</li>
<li>Minor improvements to the Rakefile.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.0.4 - 26-Oct-2007</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where methods that returned pointers (&#8216;P&#8217;) could
choke if the resulting pointer was 0 or NULL. In this case, nil is now
returned instead.

</li>
<li>Tweak to the extconf.rb file that helps the gem build it from source
properly.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.0.3 - 28-Sep-2007</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a subtle but dangerous copy-on-write bug in the API#call method.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.0.2 - 28-Sep-2007</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in an internal struct member that was causing segfaults. Thanks
go to Lars Olsson for the spot.

</li>
<li>Fixed the &#8216;install&#8217; task in the Rakefile. This only affected
native builds, not the prebuilt binary.

</li>
<li>Added a few more tests.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.0.1 - 27-Sep-2007</h2>
<ul>
<li>Functions declared with a void prototype no longer require an explicit nil
argument to fulfill the arity requirement. You can still call them with an
explicit nil if you wish, however.

</li>
<li>Fixed the gemspec for the native build.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.0.0 - 14-Sep-2007</h2>
<ul>
<li>Initial release

</li>
</ul>
